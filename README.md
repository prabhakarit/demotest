Input : 
</BR>
"Given a string with the following data (it includes multiple lines):
</BR>
2343225,2345,us_east,RedTeam,ProjectApple,3445s
</BR>
1223456,2345,us_west,BlueTeam,ProjectBanana,2211s
</BR>
3244332,2346,eu_west,YellowTeam3,ProjectCarrot,4322s
</BR>
1233456,2345,us_west,BlueTeam,ProjectDate,2221s
</BR>
3244132,2346,eu_west,YellowTeam3,ProjectEgg,4122s
</BR>
</BR>
</BR>
</BR>
Structure : 
The data is organized into columns delimited by a comma(,) in the following order:
customerId,contractId,geozone,teamcode,projectcode,buildduration
Interpretation :
The first line of data would then be interpreted as
  2343225 is the customerId
  2345 is the contractId
  us_east is the geozone
  RedTeam is the teamcode
  ProjectApple is the projectcode
  3445s is the buildduration
Outcome :
Using one of the following programming languages - JAVA/JAVA8, write code that takes the entire multiline string and produces a report containing the following:
  The number of unique customerId for each contractId.
  The number of unique customerId for each geozone.
  The average buildduration for each geozone.
  The list of unique customerId for each geozone."
 
Please consider the following guidelines in your code
1.       Create a properly structured code for ex. eclipse or IntelliJ based
2.       Proper Naming of the classes
3.       Documenting what is the purpose of the classes
4.       Clean code.
5.       Design Patterns.
6.       Design Principles.
7.       Test Cases(TDD) : Test Cases
8.       Commit the code in Github.com
I request you to solve the problem submit the code via github.
Let’s keep the ETA as .14th July.
